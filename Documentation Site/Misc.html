    <h3>These Elements include: </h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><i><b>Horizontal Rule:</b></i></dt>
        <dd>Written as &lt;hr&gt; and makes a thick line to seprate parts of the page, like the one at the end of this page.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><i><b>Line Break:</b></i></dt>
        <dd>Written as &lt;br&gt; and acts like a new line to add between elements or in p elements which remove any whitespace written in them.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><i><b>Embed:</b></i></dt>
        <dd>They add a whole website or a resource inside our page like this</dd>
        <embed src="https://wikipedia.org" width="250" frameborder="1">
        <br>
        <dt><i><b>Object:</b></i></dt>
        <dd>Acheive the same thing as embed but is more versitle as it can add pdfs or flash files<br> but has compatiablity issues with old browsers</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><i><b>Iframe:</b></i></dt>
        <dd>Achevive similar goals to object & embed but is preferred as it doesn't use java applets or plug-ins which aren't supported by modern browsers or mobile</dd>
