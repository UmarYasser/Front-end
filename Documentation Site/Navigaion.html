    <h3>The Most Important one is  &lt;a&gt; which stands for anchor link that can link to a page in the same website like the link to home page in any page of this documention or the other websites.</h3>
    <p>Anchor link require a hyper reference or 'href' to the location they're referencing like that<br> &lt;a href=" "&gt;.</p>
    <p>HTML also features &lt;nav&gt; to specify to the developers, search engines and screen readers that this's the area for navigation around the website, while not affecting the appearance of the links. Example of it is the group of links in the home page.</p>    
    <p>HTML also features linking contact information like email or telephone numbers<br> which can be done by adding 'mailto:' or 'tel:' at the beginning of href.</p>
